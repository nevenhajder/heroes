This project is a way to practise what I've learned in the Treehouse Front End Development course. 
I'll make a card for each one of my heroes, and have the cards respond to the user in some way.
Some things may not be done as simply as possible, because I'll go out of my way to use different skills.
For example, I may put together a JSON file with information for each hero.
Then I may use JavaScript of jQuery to extract that information and put it into the page.
Of course there are simpler ways to achieve the same result, but that is not the point.
The goal is to practise the different methods, even if it is a more complicated way to do things.
